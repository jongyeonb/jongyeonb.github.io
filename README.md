The "Algorithms" folder contains code used in the research paper entitled "Computer Vision-based Automated Productivity Monitoring for On-site Module Installation(AUTCON-D-23-01657)," submitted by Jongyeon Baek, Daeho Kim, and Byunjoo Choi. This code has been uploaded to facilitate the reproducibility of the proposed method presented in the paper.

Algorithm 1 addresses the issue of bounding box instability rectification, while Algorithm 2 deals with spatial relationship and sequential relevance analysis. These algorithms are integral components of the research methodology outlined in the paper. The inclusion of this code in the repository aims to provide a comprehensive and transparent means for replicating the findings and results presented in the research paper.
